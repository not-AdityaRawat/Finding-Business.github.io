In India, more than 50% of start-ups and businesses fails in just one year of their launch and the rest of the 70% fails in the next five years.

Against such odds how can we build a Successful Startup?

Every early stage start-up must have a better location - Our AI driven tool helps founders to find the best suited location for their startups.
Though as simple as it may sounds, not having a perfect location can bring losses in the competitive field.

Also Our Idea for the project is to bring forward a community exclusively for business people or enthusiasts or new founders. THe only platform 
for them to interact with each others and promote their business ideas to a mass audience who are solely interested in starting-up.

The website will provide Experts's session for the beginners and it will also serve as a gesture of giving what they have learnt to those you
are new or enthusiasts.
